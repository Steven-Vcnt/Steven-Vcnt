# Hello!

I'm currently working as a Data Engineer at Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale where I use mainly Python/SQL. 
I'm also a lecturer at ESC Dijon (Business School) for the MSc Data Science & Organizational Behaviour where I am teaching about Cloud computing and data tools.
I am working on the Azure Data Science certification as I would like to develop ML engineering skills.
