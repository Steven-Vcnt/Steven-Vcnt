# Hello!

I'm currently working as a Data Engineer at Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale where I use mainly Python/SQL.

I'm also a lecturer for the Business School ESC Dijon (Burgundy School of Business). I teach an Azure Cloud course for the MSc Data Science & Organizational Behaviour.

I am looking to develop my Data Science skills as I like to play with Public Data, I want to learn about ML Engineering.

You can contact me through LinkedIn ( ([linkedin.com/in/vincent-steven](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincent-steven/)) ) or by mail ( [steven.vincentGNR@gmail.com](steven.vincentGNR@gmail.com) ).
