## Install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is an IDE developed by Microsoft which aims you to program in different languages like Python.

You can install VS Code directly from their website with the following link:

!!! note
    You will need to install Python if you don't already have it. You can also install other extension if you want.

## Create or connect to Github

For this course we will use GitHub, so we need you to create an account if it is not already the case. You can either use your BSB mail address or your personnal mail address. If you already have a GitHub account, you can use it.

You should now be ready to start the workshop!
