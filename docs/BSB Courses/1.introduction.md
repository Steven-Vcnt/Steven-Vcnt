## Python syntax

### Variable assignment and naming convention

You can assign value to a variable. In this example, we assign the value 'hello world to the variable x.

```python
x='hello world'
print("The variable has the value:", x)
```

You can overwrite the value of a variable if you assign another value to the same variable

```python
x=3
print(x)
```

!!! warning
    Be careful when you assign different values to the same variable as in Jupyter Notebook you can mix up the assignment if you    don't execute cells in the right order.

To assign a variable we need to find a variable name that should describe the data we will store. A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for Python variables:

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-Z, 0-9, and _ ) 
- A variable name is case-sensitive (age, Age, and AGE are three different variables)
- A variable name cannot be any of the [Python keywords](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp>).

!!! note
    As a naming convention, you can either use mixed case naming (camel case) or lowercase with words separated by underscores(snake case).

    ``` python
    camelCase = 'mixed case'
    snake_case = 'words separated by underscore'
    ```

### Python data type

Boolean type may have one of two values True or False. It aims to evaluate an expression through those values.

```python
t_boolean = True
print(type(t_boolean))
compute_boolean = 1 + 1 == 1
print(compute_boolean)
```

Integers are whole numbers on which you can perform arithmetic operations. It can either be positive or negative without length restrictions.

```python
t_integer = 12
print(type(t_integer))
compute_integer =40 + 6 - 2
print(compute_integer)
```

Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

```python
t_float = 12.58
print(type(t float))
compute float = 1.5 + 10.7 + 4.9
print(compute float)
```

Strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. It is used to store 'text' and can be accessed through their position (It works more or less like a list of characters). It is possible to use arithmetics operation on string with a behavioral change compared to integers.

```python
t_string = 'Hello'
print(type(t_string))
compute_string= '400' + '4' + ' Error'
print(compute_string)
```

!!! note
    Strings in Python are surrounded by either single quotation marks or double quotation marks. 'hello' is the same as "hello". You can also assign a multiline string to a variable using three quotes before and after.
    ``` python
    single_quote = 'Hello'
    doulbe_quote = "Hello"
    multilign_string = '''This is
    a multiline string
    If you need to store
    long arrays of characters.
    '''
    ```

### Python data structures

Python Lists are a way to store multi-values within a variable. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type. We can access list values and we can delete/append new values easily.

```python

t_list['Chapter', 1, 'This", "Is, a', 'list', 'of', 'strings", "."]
print(t_list)
```

Dictionary are unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, Dictionary holds the key:value pair. We can store different types of data and store nested data to be accessed at different levels.

```python
t_dictionary ('Peugeot': 306, "Mercedes-Benz": "C220", "Audi": "A4")
print(t_list)
```

You can store complex data within a dictionary with multiple levels of data.

```python
#Here is an example of a nested dictionary
t_nested_dict = [

                    {
                        "state": "Florida",
                        "shortname":"FL",
                        "Info": {"governor": "Rick Scott"},
                        "Counties": [ 
                            {"name": "Dade", "population": 12345}, 
                            {"name": "Broward", "population": 40000},
                            {"name": "Palm Beach", "population": 60000},
                        ],
                    },
                    {
                        "state": "Ohio",
                        "shortname": "OH",
                        "info": {"governor":"John Kasich"},
                        "counties": [
                            {"name": "Summit", "population": 1234}, 
                            {"name": "Cuyahoga", "population": 1337},
                        ],
                    },
                ]
print(t_nested_dict)
```

Python Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list but Tuples are immutable in nature L.e. the elements in the tuple cannot be added or removed once created, hit like a List, Tuple can also contain elements of various types.

```python
t_tuple = ('This', 'is', 'a', 'tuple.') 
print(t_tuple)
```

A Dataframe is a 2 dimensional data structure, like a 2 dimensional array, or a table with rows and columns.

```python
Import pandas as pd
data = {
    "City": ['Paris', 'Lyon', 'Bordeaux'],
    "Population": [2161000, 513275, 249712]
}
t_dataframe = pd.Dataframe(data) 
print(t_dataframe)
```

### Data manipulation

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

```python
cartes = ['Infinite', 'Platinium', 'Gold', 'Classic']
for carte in cartes:
    print(carte)
```

With the while loop, we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

```python
montant = O
plafond = 100
while montant < plafond:
    print(montant) 
    montant += 10
```

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

- Equals: a == b
- Not Equals: a != b
- Less than: a < b
- Less than or equal to: a <= b
- Greater than: a > b
- Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops. An "If statement" is used with the "if" function.

```python
montant_compte = 50 
if montant_compte < -500:
    print("Compte en contentieux")
elif montant_compte < 0:
    print("Compte débiteur")
else: 
    print('Compte créditeur")
```

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result. Information can be passed into function through arguments. Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a coma.

```python
def check_account_statut (montant_compte):
    if montant_compte < -500: 
        statut='Compte en contentieux'
    elif montant_compte < 0:
        statut="Compte débiteur"
    else:
        statut='Compte créditeur'
    return statut
```

### Python install and import a new Package

Before you can install any package within your VS Code repository, you will need to create an environment.
There are several ways to create a Python environment (Conda environment, venv through command line). In our case we will create a venv environment through the [VS Code GUI](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_creating-environments).
Now we can install the package you want to use. In our case, we will install pandas. Pandas is an open-source data analysis and manipulation tool.

```python
pip install pandas
```

Once it is installed, you can import your new package and start to use the pandas' function. Here we have decided to add an alias to the import to avoid writing pandas before each pandas function. We can just use pd.{the pandas function to be used}.

```python
import pandas as pd # as keywords aim to create an alias. It allows you to use the function shortcut instead of the whole name
pd.DataFrame() # Function to transform an array/dict/iterable to a DataFrame type
```

Whenever you need to import only one function from your package you can use from (package} import (function).

```python
from pandas import DataFrame
```

!!! note
    You have several ways to install a Python package:
    Directly from your notebook:

    ```python
    !pip install {package}
    #OR
    %pip install {package}
    ```

    Directly from your terminal (Terminal>New Terminal>Command Prompt or Terminal>New Terminal>Powershell ):

    ```sh
    pip install {package}
    ```

    {: warning}
    If you try to execute some code through Powershell, you may have the error :  Impossible to load the file Activate. because     cripts execution is deactivated on this system.
    Consult about_Execution_Policies through the following [Microsoft documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?  inkID=135170).
    You can execute the following Powershell command directly in the terminal:

    ```Powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
    ```
