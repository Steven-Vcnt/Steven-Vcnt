# Steven Vincent

## Hello !

I'm currently working as a Data Engineer at Société Générale where I use mainly Python/SQL.

I'm also a lecturer for the Business School ESC Dijon (Burgundy School of Business). I teach an Azure Cloud course for the MSc Data Science & Organizational Behaviour.

I am looking to develop my Data Science skills as I like to play with Public Data, I want to learn about ML Engineering.
