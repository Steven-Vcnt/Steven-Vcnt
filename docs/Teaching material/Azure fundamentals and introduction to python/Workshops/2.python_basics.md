## Python syntax

### Variable assignment and naming convention

You can assign value to a variable. In this example, we assign the value 'hello world' to the variable x.

```python
x='hello world'
print("The variable has the value:", x)
```

You can overwrite the value of a variable if you assign another value to the same variable

```python
x=3
print(x)
```

!!! warning
    Be careful when you assign different values to the same variable as in Jupyter Notebook you can mix up the assignment if you don't execute cells in the right order.

To assign a variable we need to find a variable name that should describe the data we will store. A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for Python variables:

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-Z, 0-9, and _ )
- A variable name is case-sensitive (age, Age, and AGE are three different variables)
- A variable name cannot be any of the [Python keywords](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp).

!!! note
    As a naming convention, you can either use mixed case naming (camel case) or lowercase with words separated by underscores(snake case).

    ``` python
    camelCase = 'mixed case'
    snake_case = 'words separated by underscore'
    ```

### Python data type

#### Boolean

Boolean type may have one of two values True or False. It aims to evaluate an expression through those values.

```python
t_boolean = True
print(type(t_boolean))
compute_boolean = 1 + 1 == 1
print(compute_boolean)
```

#### Integers

Integers are whole numbers on which you can perform arithmetic operations. It can either be positive or negative without length restrictions.

```python
t_integer = 12
print(type(t_integer))
compute_integer =40 + 6 - 2
print(compute_integer)
```

#### Float

Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

```python
t_float = 12.58
print(type(t_float))
compute_float = 1.5 + 10.7 + 4.9
print(compute_float)
```

#### String

Strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. It is used to store 'text' and can be accessed through their position (It works more or less like a list of characters). It is possible to use arithmetics operation on string with a behavioral change compared to integers.

```python
t_string = 'Hello'
print(type(t_string))
compute_string= '400' + '4' + ' Error'
print(compute_string)
```

!!! note
    Strings in Python are surrounded by either single quotation marks or double quotation marks. 'hello' is the same as "hello". You can also assign a multiline string to a variable using three quotes before and after.

    ```python
    single_quote = 'Hello'
    doulbe_quote = "Hello"
    multilign_string = '''This is
    a multiline string
    If you need to store
    long arrays of characters.
    '''
    ```

### Python data structures

#### List

Python Lists are a way to store multi-values within a variable. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type. We can access list values and we can delete/append new values easily.

```python
t_list=['Chapter', 1, 'This', 'Is', 'a', 'list', 'of', 'strings', '.']
print(t_list)
```

#### Dictionary

Dictionaries are unordered collections of data values, used to store data values like a map, it holds the Key:Value pair. We can store different types of data and store nested data to be accessed at different levels.

```python
t_dictionary = {'Peugeot': 306, "Mercedes-Benz": "C220", "Audi": "A4"}
print(t_dictionary)
```

You can store complex data within a dictionary with multiple levels of data.

```python title="Example of a nested dictionary"
t_nested_dict = [

                    {
                        "state": "Florida",
                        "shortname":"FL",
                        "Info": {"governor": "Rick Scott"},
                        "Counties": [ 
                            {"name": "Dade", "population": 12345}, 
                            {"name": "Broward", "population": 40000},
                            {"name": "Palm Beach", "population": 60000},
                        ],
                    },
                    {
                        "state": "Ohio",
                        "shortname": "OH",
                        "info": {"governor":"John Kasich"},
                        "counties": [
                            {"name": "Summit", "population": 1234}, 
                            {"name": "Cuyahoga", "population": 1337},
                        ],
                    },
                ]
print(t_nested_dict)
```

#### Tuple

Python Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list but Tuples are immutable. The elements in the tuple cannot be added or removed once created, like a List, a Tuple can also contain elements of various types.

```python
t_tuple = ('This', 'is', 'a', 'tuple.') 
print(t_tuple)
```

#### DataFrame

A Dataframe is a 2 dimensional data structure, like a 2 dimensional array, or a table with rows and columns.

```python
import pandas as pd
data = {
    "City": ['Paris', 'Lyon', 'Bordeaux'],
    "Population": [2161000, 513275, 249712]
}
t_dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data) 
print(t_dataframe)
```

### Data manipulation

#### For loop

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

```python
cartes = ['Infinite', 'Platinium', 'Gold', 'Classic']
for carte in cartes:
    print(carte)
```

#### While

With the while loop, we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

```python
montant = 0
plafond = 100
while montant < plafond:
    print(montant) 
    montant += 10
```

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

- Equals is **a == b**
- Not Equals is **a != b**
- Less than is **a < b**
- Less than or equal to is **a <= b**
- Greater than: **a > b**
- Greater than or equal to is **a >= b**
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops. An "If statement" is used with the "if" function.

```python
montant_compte = 50 
if montant_compte < -500:
    print("Compte en contentieux")
elif montant_compte < 0:
    print("Compte débiteur")
else: 
    print("Compte créditeur")
```

### Function

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result. Information can be passed into function through arguments. Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a coma.

```python
def check_account_statut (montant_compte):
    if montant_compte < -500: 
        statut='Compte en contentieux'
    elif montant_compte < 0:
        statut="Compte débiteur"
    else:
        statut='Compte créditeur'
    return statut
```

### Example - Generate and merge multiple files

import glob
```
